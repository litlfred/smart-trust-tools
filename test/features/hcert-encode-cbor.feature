@case:hcert-encode-cbor
Feature: Serialise as deterministic CBOR, and decode untrusted CBOR within limits
  Step 4 of issuance: the claims are serialised as RFC 8949 deterministic
  CBOR. Untrusted CBOR is decoded within limits, and refused with a typed error.

  @test:tools/hcert-rust/tests/encode_cbor.rs::stt_cbr_001_maps_are_encoded_in_deterministic_key_order
  Scenario: Maps are encoded in deterministic key order (Rust)
    Given the map {"b": 2, -1: 1, 10: 3}
    And the same map with its entries built in reverse order
    When both are encoded as CBOR
    Then the two encodings are identical
    And the encoding is the hex a30a032001616202, with the keys in the order 10, -1, "b"

  @test:tools/hcert-rust/tests/encode_cbor.rs::stt_cbr_001_rfc_8949_appendix_a_numbers_re_encode_in_their_shortest_form
  Scenario: RFC 8949 Appendix A numbers re-encode in their shortest form (Rust)
    Given these RFC 8949 Appendix A items, already in preferred serialisation:
      | 1b000000e8d4a51000 | 3b7fffffffffffffff | f90000             | f98000 |
      | f93c00             | fb3ff199999999999a | f93e00             | f97bff |

    When each is re-encoded deterministically
    Then each comes back unchanged
    And items sent longer than they need are shortened:

  Scenario: Text is NFC-normalised on encode (Rust)
    Given the text "Hoa" followed by a combining grave accent (U+0300)

  Scenario: Malformed or oversized input is refused with a typed error (Rust)
    When each of these malformed items is re-encoded deterministically with the default limits
      | 5f42010243         |
      | 5f4201026103ff     |

    Then each is refused with an error
    And 40 nested one-element arrays around a 0 are refused with LimitExceeded
    And a byte string of 0x5000 bytes is refused with LimitExceeded

  Scenario: Maps are encoded in deterministic key order, whatever order they were built in (Kotlin)
    Given the map {"b": 2, -1: 1, 10: 3}
    And the same map with its entries built in reverse order
    When both are encoded as CBOR

  Scenario: Text is NFC-normalised on encode, and a non-normalised string still decodes (Kotlin)
    Given the text "Hoa" followed by a combining grave accent (U+0300)
    When it is encoded as CBOR and decoded again
    Then the text is "Hoà" with the precomposed U+00E0
