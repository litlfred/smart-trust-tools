# Test-plan case hcert-trust-list (test/plans/hcert-library-conformance.test-plan.json).
# One Scenario per executable test; the @test: tag names the test that runs it.
@case:hcert-trust-list
Feature: Hold the trusted DSCs the host obtained, and find every candidate for a kid
  The host obtains the trust material (PEM, DER, GDHCN DID trustlist v2) and
  the library holds the DSCs, finding every candidate for a kid. A trust list
  DID document's proof is verified against WHO's signing DID before its keys
  are trusted.

  @test:tools/hcert-rust/src/didproof.rs::base64url_is_strict
  Scenario: The proof's base64url is read strictly (Rust)
    When "AQ" is read as base64url
    Then it gives the single byte 1
    And "AR", whose trailing bits are not zero, is refused
    And "AQ==", which is padded, is refused
    And "A", a dangling character, is refused
    And "+/", from the standard alphabet, is refused

  @test:tools/hcert-rust/src/didproof.rs::jcs_sorts_by_utf16_and_escapes
  Scenario: The JWK's JCS sorts members by UTF-16 code unit, and escapes (Rust)
    Given the JWK {"😀":"a","｡":"b","x":["\"\\"]}
    When it is written as JCS
    Then the members come in the order "x", U+1F600, U+FF61, by UTF-16 code unit rather than by code point
    And the quote and backslash in "x" are escaped
    And a JWK holding DEL in a string is refused
    And a JWK holding a newline in an array string is refused
    And a JWK holding a number, an array of objects, or a duplicate member name is refused
    And a JWK that is an array, or no JWK at all, is refused
    And an N-Quads literal escapes backslash, quote, newline and carriage return
    And a JCS string escapes backspace, form feed, tab and carriage return as \b, \f, \t and \r

  @test:tools/hcert-rust/tests/trust_list.rs::stt_tru_005_stt_kid_002_pem_loads_once_and_candidates_are_found_by_kid
  Scenario: PEM loads once, and bad material is refused (Rust)
    Given an empty trust store
    When the PR 129 XXA DSC PEM file is added
    Then 2 certificates are added
    And adding the same PEM again adds 0
    And adding the PEM text "nothing" fails with Parse
    And adding the DER bytes 30 03 02 01 01 fails with Parse

  @test:tools/hcert-rust/tests/trust_list.rs::stt_tru_002_stt_sel_006_did_documents_load_and_trust_domains_come_from_the_code_system
  Scenario: DID documents load, and trust domains come from the code system (Rust)
    Given an empty trust store with no trust domains loaded
    When a DID trustlist v2 document for domain "FUTURE" holding the testkit ES256 DSC is added
    Then 1 DSC is added, and its candidate's trust domain is "FUTURE"
    When a new store loads the GDHCN Domains code system
    Then 4 domains are loaded: DDCC, ICVP, IPS-PILGRIMAGE and PH4H
    And adding the "FUTURE" document fails with UnknownTrustDomain "FUTURE"
    And adding the same DSC under domain "DDCC" adds 1
    And adding the testkit PS256 DSC under the wildcard domain "-" adds 1
    And loading a ValueSet as the trust domains fails with Parse

  @req:stt-tru-006
  @test:tools/hcert-rust/tests/trust_list.rs::stt_tru_006_canonical_n_quads_equal_the_golden_files
  Scenario: The XXR DSC document's canonical N-Quads equal the golden files (Rust)
    Given the XXR DSC DID document from the merged guide
    When its document and its proof options are canonicalised
    Then the document's N-Quads equal XXR-DSC-did.doc.nq byte for byte
    And the proof options' N-Quads equal XXR-DSC-did.proof-options.nq byte for byte

  @req:stt-tru-006
  @test:tools/hcert-rust/tests/trust_list.rs::stt_tru_006_dev_trust_list_documents_verify_against_who_signing_did
  Scenario Outline: The DEV trust list documents verify against WHO's signing DID (Rust)
    Given WHO's DEV signing DID document
    When the proof of <document> is verified
    Then it verifies

    Examples:
      | document                          |
      | XXR-DSC-did.json (merged guide)   |
      | XXR-DSC-did-2026-10-23.json       |
      | XXR-did.json                      |
      | XXA-did.json                      |

  Scenario: A changed byte, the wrong signer, an unmodelled term or header is proof-invalid (Rust)
    Given the XXR DSC DID document, whose proof verifies against WHO's signing DID
    Then each of these fails with ProofInvalid, its message containing:

  @req:stt-tru-006
  @test:tools/hcert-rust/tests/trust_list.rs::stt_tru_006_a_64_byte_r_s_signature_also_verifies
  Scenario: A 64-byte r||s signature also verifies (Rust)
    Given the XXR DSC DID document
    When its DER proof signature is re-encoded as 64-byte r||s
    Then the proof verifies against WHO's signing DID
    And with the DER signature's last byte cut off it fails with ProofInvalid

  @req:stt-tru-006
  @test:tools/hcert-rust/tests/trust_list.rs::stt_tru_006_add_verified_did_document_adds_only_verified_documents
  Scenario: Adding a verified DID document adds only verified documents (Rust)
    Given an empty trust store and WHO's DEV signing DID document
    When XXR-did.json with an "ext" member added to a JWK is added as verified
    Then it fails with ProofInvalid and the store stays empty
    When XXR-did.json itself is added as verified
    Then 2 DSCs are added and the store holds 2
    And adding the XXR DSC document as verified adds 0, its DSC already held through XXR

  @req:stt-tru-006
  @test:tools/hcert-rust/tests/trust_list.rs::stt_tru_006_signer_coordinates_and_profile_variants
  Scenario: Signer coordinates, and the profile's variants (Rust)
    Given the XXR DSC DID document and WHO's signing DID document
    Then the proof verifies when the signer's x has a leading 00 byte, as a Java BigInteger writes it
    And with two leading 00 bytes it fails with ProofInvalid mentioning "32 bytes"
    And with the signer's curve P-384 it fails with ProofInvalid mentioning "P-256"
    And a reference document whose verification methods are two equal DID URLs canonicalises to one controller quad and one verificationMethod quad
    And with the UAT tng-context the PH4H domain is read under ValueSet-Domains-UAT.jsonld
    And with the production tng-context the DSC key usage is read under ValueSet-KeyUsage.jsonld
    And a relative id, a domain code that is not a fragment, a key usage of "#", a non-JsonWebKey2020 type, and a numeric kty are each proof-invalid
    And proof options with a control character in the nonce, proofPurpose "authentication", type "Ed25519Signature2020", or a verification method that is not a DID are each refused
    And proof options with a domain "tng" and a challenge "c" canonicalise with a domain and a challenge quad, but the proof no longer verifies
    And the reference document, which has no proof, has its proof options refused
    And a verificationMethod that is an object is proof-invalid

  Scenario: The unified profile's rows give the same verdict (Rust)
    Given the XXR DSC DID document and WHO's signing DID document
    Then each of these edits fails with ProofInvalid, its message containing:

    And a JWS header with alg twice fails with ProofInvalid mentioning "twice"
    And the JSON reader keeps the last duplicate member unless asked to refuse duplicates, and refuses the escapes "\u+123", "\u12" and "\u-001"
