@case:hcert-assemble-payload
Feature: Build and validate the payload against its logical model
  Step 2 of issuance: build the payload and validate it against its logical
  model (DVCMin, or a VHL payload), keeping unknown elements.

  @test:tools/hcert-rust/tests/payload.rs::stt_pay_001_stt_pay_008_a_dvcmin_round_trips_and_keeps_unknown_elements
  Scenario: A DVCMin round-trips through CBOR and keeps unknown elements (Rust)
    Given a newborn's DVCMin with an unknown element "zz" holding the text "kept"
    When it is encoded to CBOR and decoded again
    Then the result equals the original, "zz" included

  @test:tools/hcert-rust/tests/payload.rs::stt_pay_002_stt_pay_003_the_logical_model_rules_are_checked
  Scenario: The logical model's rules are checked (Rust)
    Given a newborn's DVCMin with nt "LA", dob "2026-13-01" and no vaccine issuer
    When it is validated
    Then the issue codes include "not-alpha3", "invalid-date" and "must-have-issuer-or-clinician-name"
    And the unchanged newborn's DVCMin validates with no issues

  @test:tools/hcert-rust/tests/payload.rs::stt_pay_004_stt_pay_007_an_invalid_payload_is_refused_naming_each_rule
  Scenario: An invalid payload is refused, naming each rule (Rust)
    Given a newborn's DVCMin with nt "LA" and neither a vaccine issuer nor a clinician name
    When it is prepared for issuance
    Then it fails with PayloadInvalid
    And the distinct issue codes are exactly "must-have-issuer-or-clinician-name" and "not-alpha3"
    And a newborn's DVCMin with the user-assigned nt "XXA" validates with no issues

  @test:tools/hcert-rust/tests/payload.rs::stt_pay_005_a_newborns_dvcmin_has_no_identity_document_and_names_a_guardian
  Scenario: A newborn's DVCMin has no identity document and names a guardian (Rust)
    Given a newborn's DVCMin with no id, no dt and gn "Test MOTHER"
    Then validating it gives no blocking issue
    When it is issued with ES256 and verified
    Then the verified DVCMin also has no id, no dt and gn "Test MOTHER"

  @test:tools/hcert-rust/tests/payload.rs::stt_pay_009_stt_gen_003_another_payload_passes_through_the_core_untouched
  Scenario Outline: Another payload passes through the core untouched (Rust)
    Given a raw payload {"<key>": "x"} under subclaim <subclaim>
    When it is issued with <alg> and verified against the <alg> testkit DSC
    Then the one entry is the raw payload under <subclaim>, its CBOR unchanged

    Examples:
      | subclaim | key | alg   |
      | 4        | t   | PS256 |
      | 1        | v   | ES256 |

  Scenario: A newborn's DVCMin, with no identity document, round-trips as typed fields (Kotlin)
    Given a newborn's DVCMin with no identity document
    Then validating it gives no blocking issue

  Scenario: Unknown payload elements are kept (Kotlin)
    Given a newborn's DVCMin with an unknown element "zz"
    When it is issued and verified
    Then the verified DVCMin's extensions are "zz" alone, with the same CBOR bytes

  Scenario: Another payload passes through the core untouched (Kotlin)
    Given a raw payload {"t": "x"} under subclaim 4
    When it is issued with PS256 and verified against the PS256 testkit DSC
    Then the one entry is a raw payload with the same CBOR bytes
    And there are no diagnostics

  Scenario: ES256 and PS256 issue and verify, and the COSE bytes travel without the QR layers (TypeScript, either package)
    Given a newborn's DVCMin issued with ES256
    And a raw payload {"t": "x"} under subclaim 4 issued with PS256, whose DSC allows test certificates only
    Then each HC1 string verifies against its own testkit DSC
    And the ES256 HC1 string decodes to exactly the issued COSE bytes
    And each issued COSE_Sign1 verifies on its own, without the QR layers
